Project Overview
</h1>
 <p>
   This project aims to create a CNC Drawing machine using a PIC microcontroller. We create our own custom firmware that drives the two step motors using embedded C and a G-code parser to convert g-code into C instructions compatible with our custom firmware. G-code is generated from a digital drawing that a user wants to draw using the Inkscape drawing program and an extension.
